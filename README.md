# weather-app

This is a weather app that allows you to input a city name and it will tell you the temperature and a description of the weather conditions.
The weather information is coming from openweathermap.org. I coded the app so that when you input a city the information just for that city
will be pulled from that site. The information is then put into a sentence format which is what you see after hitting enter or clicking the
"get weather" button. I wanted to create this in order to challenge myself and learn programming languages I'd never used before.
